# _Computability and algorithm, task 7: The Powerset construction._
### By Basilio GÃ³mez Navarro. November, 2019.

## The program:
 - The program reads a ".nfa" input file with the definition of a
   _Nondeterministic Finite Automaton_ and generates a ".dfa" file with the DFA
   specification resulting from applying the Powerset construction.

## How to use the program:
  - The program is called "NFA2DFA", so to excute it:
   ./NFA2DFA [inputFile.nfa] [outputFile.dfa]
  - If the program is executed  without parameters, it  will show a small
    message explaning how to run the program.
  - Also the "--help" parameter is aviable, so if you execute "./NFA2DFA --help"
    a unix-style help message will be displayed, detailing how to run the
    program correctly.
